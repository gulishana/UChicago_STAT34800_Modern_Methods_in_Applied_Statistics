```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Here we read in the "zipcode" training data, and extract the 2s and 3s.
```{r}
z = read.table("zip.train.txt")
sub = (z[,1]==2) | (z[,1]==3)
z23 = as.matrix(z[sub, ])
```



Now we run svd (excluding the first column which are the labels)
```{r}
z23.svd = svd(z23[ ,-1])  # first column are labels
```



Plot the **first two two singular vectors**, colored by group, we see the **second singular vector** separates the groups reasonably well.

```{r}
# plot the first two two singular vectors
plot(z23.svd$u[,1], z23.svd$u[,2], col=z23[,1])
```


And a histogram suggests **a mixture of two Gaussians** might be a reasonable start:
```{r}
hist(z23.svd$u[,2], breaks=seq(-0.07,0.07,length=20))
```
